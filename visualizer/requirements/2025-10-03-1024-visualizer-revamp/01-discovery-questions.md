# Discovery Questions

These questions will help understand the problem space and desired enhancements for the SpaceTraders visualizer.

## Q1: Should the visualizer track historical data (ship movements, cargo changes, profits) over time?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (historical data enables analytics, performance tracking, and informed decision-making for fleet management)

**Why this matters:** Historical tracking would enable features like performance metrics, trade route analysis, profitability tracking, and playback of past fleet movements. This is a natural evolution from real-time tracking to strategic analysis.

## Q2: Should users be able to send commands to ships (navigate, dock, trade) directly from the visualizer?
**Default if unknown:** No (visualizer's current design is read-only monitoring; adding control requires careful UX and error handling design)

**Why this matters:** This determines whether the app remains a monitoring tool or becomes a fleet command center. Adding control capabilities would require new UI paradigms, confirmation dialogs, and handling of command failures.

## Q3: Should the visualizer display market data and trade opportunities across systems?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (SpaceTraders is fundamentally about trading; showing market data helps players make better economic decisions)

**Why this matters:** Market visualization would add economic intelligence to the spatial view, helping players identify profitable trade routes, track price fluctuations, and spot arbitrage opportunities.

## Q4: Should multiple star systems be visible simultaneously in a galaxy/sector view?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (fleet operations often span multiple systems; a broader view helps with strategic planning)

**Why this matters:** Currently users can only view one system at a time. A multi-system view would show the bigger picture of fleet distribution, inter-system routes, and strategic positioning across the galaxy.

## Q5: Should the visualizer provide notifications/alerts for important events (low fuel, cargo full, arrival, market opportunities)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (monitoring multiple ships is cognitively demanding; automated alerts reduce mental load and prevent issues)

**Why this matters:** Alert systems help players react quickly to time-sensitive situations and manage larger fleets more effectively without constant manual monitoring.
