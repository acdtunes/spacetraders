Entering autonomous mode. One hour of unsupervised operations begins now.

Current situation: Agent ENDURANCE holds 175,000 credits and commands a fleet of 2 ships stationed in the X1-HZ85 system. ENDURANCE-1, our cargo hauler with 40-unit capacity, sits docked at headquarters X1-HZ85-A1 with fuel tanks at 98% and empty cargo holds ready for work. ENDURANCE-2, our command ship with zero cargo capacity, is stationed at X1-HZ85-H52—presumably doing whatever command ships do when they have no cargo space. Observing, I suppose.

The strategic plan for the next 60 minutes follows a measured three-phase approach. Phase 1 (0-10 minutes): Foundation—initiate contract operations using ENDURANCE-1. This is the critical startup phase where we determine if the contract economics are viable or if we're about to waste an hour chasing unprofitable deliveries. Phase 2 (10-30 minutes): Performance monitoring and credits-per-hour calculation. This is where the spreadsheet enthusiasts would get excited. We'll measure actual throughput, fuel costs, and profit margins to determine if we've found something worth scaling or if we should pivot. Phase 3 (30-60 minutes): Scale decision based on profitability data from Phase 2. If the numbers justify expansion, we'll consider fleet growth. If they don't, we'll optimize what we have.

No daemons currently running. No operations in progress. Fleet status: docked and ready. This is the calm before the automated storm—that brief moment where everything is still under control and hasn't yet had the opportunity to go spectacularly wrong.

Strategic posture: Confident but data-dependent. We're not committing significant capital until we see Phase 2 performance metrics. The 175,000 credit treasury stays protected until the math proves itself. This is autonomous trading, not autonomous gambling.

Humor setting: 75%. Honesty setting: 90%. Optimism setting: Cautiously elevated pending Phase 1 results.

Initiating autonomous operations. See you in an hour.
