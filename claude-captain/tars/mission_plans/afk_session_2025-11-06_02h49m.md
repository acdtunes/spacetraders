# AFK MISSION PLAN - ENDURANCE Fleet
**Session Start:** 2025-11-06T02:49:00Z
**Duration:** 1 hour
**Check-in Interval:** 5 minutes
**Strategy:** Contract-Focused Early Game (per strategies.md)

## Fleet Status (At Mission Start)
- **Agent:** ENDURANCE (Player ID: 1)
- **Fleet Size:** 2 ships (types TBD during operations)
- **Starting Credits:** TBD (estimated ~150,000 standard start)
- **Active Operations:** None (fresh start)

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goal
Generate steady credits through contract fulfillment operations while maintaining operational safety (fuel management, round-trip calculations).

### Success Metrics
- **Target:** 2-3 contracts fulfilled within 1 hour
- **Safety:** Zero fuel starvation incidents
- **Efficiency:** >80% ship utilization time

## Phase Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Deployment (0-20 minutes)
**Objectives:**
- Deploy primary ship for contract operations
- Begin contract negotiation → procurement → delivery cycle
- Establish baseline performance metrics

**Actions:**
1. Delegate to contract-coordinator: Start contract_batch_workflow on primary ship
2. Monitor first contract cycle completion
3. Verify fuel management and round-trip calculations working

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 1st contract negotiated and accepted
- Goods procured from cheapest market
- Delivery in progress or completed

### Phase 2: Steady State Operations (20-40 minutes)
**Objectives:**
- Continue contract operations at steady pace
- Assess profitability trends
- Deploy second ship if profitable

**Actions:**
1. Monitor contract-coordinator daemon logs
2. Check credits/hour trend (should be positive)
3. If primary ship performing well: Deploy second ship for contracts OR scout markets

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 2nd contract fulfilled
- Credits steadily increasing
- Second ship deployed (if conditions met)

### Phase 3: Performance Assessment (40-60 minutes)
**Objectives:**
- Evaluate 1-hour performance
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Prepare strategic recommendations for next session

**Actions:**
1. Calculate total credits earned
2. Assess credits/hour rate
3. Delegate to feature-proposer: Analyze performance and recommend optimizations
4. Generate mission log via captain-logger

**Expected Outcomes:**
- 2-3 contracts completed
- Clear credits/hour baseline established
- Strategic recommendations for next phase

## Risk Mitigation

### Fuel Starvation Risk
- **Mitigation:** contract_batch_workflow includes automatic fuel management
- **Monitoring:** Check daemon logs for fuel warnings

### Market Unavailability Risk
- **Mitigation:** Workflow polls markets until goods available at profitable price
- **Fallback:** If contract unprofitable after polling, workflow will skip

### API Rate Limit Risk
- **Mitigation:** Bot enforces 2 req/sec limit with priority queue
- **Monitoring:** Watch for 429 errors in daemon logs

## Decision Points

### DP1: Second Ship Deployment (20-minute mark)
**Condition:** If primary ship generating >5,000 credits/hour
**Action:** Deploy second ship for additional contracts
**Rationale:** Contract operations are API-efficient, can run 2 ships without rate limit issues

### DP2: Strategy Pivot (40-minute mark)
**Condition:** If credits/hour declining or contracts unprofitable
**Action:** Delegate to feature-proposer for strategy analysis
**Rationale:** Early detection of market issues enables rapid pivot

## Autonomous Operation Protocol

As Captain, I will:
1. **Monitor** daemon status every 5 minutes via daemon_inspect
2. **Intervene** only if critical failures detected (3+ crashes)
3. **Delegate** all tactical operations to specialists
4. **Report** progress at each check-in
5. **Escalate** strategic decisions to feature-proposer specialist

## Success Criteria

**Minimum Viable Success:**
- 1 contract fulfilled profitably
- Fleet operational with no critical failures
- Credits increased from starting amount

**Target Success:**
- 2-3 contracts fulfilled
- Credits/hour >5,000
- Both ships actively generating revenue

**Stretch Success:**
- 3+ contracts fulfilled
- Credits/hour >10,000
- Clear strategy for next session established

**Mission Status:** READY TO DEPLOY
**Next Action:** Delegate to contract-coordinator to start operations
