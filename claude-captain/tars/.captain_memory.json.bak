Here's the tactical situation:\n\n**Current Status:**\n- **Fleet:** 6 vessels completely idle (0% utilization)\n- **Credits:** Unknown (need to check)\n- **Failed Operations:** 1 contract batch workflow error on CHROMESAMURAI-1\n- **Default Player:** COOPER (player_id=2)\n\n**Fleet Composition:**\n- CHROMESAMURAI-1: Unknown class at X1-GZ7-C47\n- CHROMESAMURAI-2: SATELLITE at X1-GZ7-A4 (probe)\n- CHROMESAMURAI-3-6: Unknown class, scattered across system\n\n**Immediate Concerns:**\n1. Failed contract operation needs investigation\n2. Entire fleet standing by - zero revenue generation\n3. Need ship classifications and credit status\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n**Option A - Resume Contract Operations** (if we have good credits)\n- Investigate failed contract daemon\n- Restart contract fulfillment on CHROMESAMURAI-1\n\n**Option B - Deploy Probe Network** (if we need market intelligence)\n- Use CHROMESAMURAI-2 (satellite) + convert others to scouts\n- Map market prices across system\n\n**Option C - Start Mining Operations** (if we have miners)\n- Identify mining-capable vessels\n- Deploy to asteroid fields with probe coverage\n\nWhat's your priority, Admiral? Should I:\n1. **Investigate the failed contract operation and resume?**\n2. **Deploy probe network for market intelligence?**\n3. **Check ship specs and recommend optimal deployment?**\n\nStanding by for strategic directive.",

Admiral, fleet status report:\n\n**Fleet Situation:**\n- **All 6 vessels idle** (0% utilization)\n- **1 failed operation** detected (contract-batch daemon)\n- **5 stopped daemons** from previous operations\n- Default player: **COOPER** (player_id=2)\n\n**Critical Issue:** Failed contract operation on CHROMESAMURAI-1 needs investigation.\n\n**Recommended Actions:**\n\n1. **Investigate Failed Operation** - Determine root cause of contract-batch failure\n2. **Deploy Contract Operations** - Resume profitable contract fulfillment \n3. **Establish Market Intelligence** - Deploy probe network for price monitoring\n4. **Optimize Fleet Assignments** - Assign specialized roles based on ship types\n\n**Immediate Tactical Options:**\n\n**Option A: Contract-Focused (Conservative)**\n- Investigate failure, then resume contract operations with 2-3 ships\n- Deploy 2-3 probes for market monitoring\n- Estimated: Steady income, lower risk\n\n**Option B: Market Intelligence First (Recommended)**\n- Deploy probe network immediately (identify satellites)\n- Parallel contract operations with command ship\n- Estimated: Better long-term positioning\n\n**Option C: Full Fleet Analysis**\n- Deep dive into ship capabilities and system opportunities\n- Optimize assignments before deployment\n- Estimated: Best efficiency, slower start\n\n**Your orders, Admiral?** I recommend Option B for balanced risk/reward, but awaiting your strategic directive.",

Admiral, I can see the system has player configuration tools available. Let me query the SpaceTraders system to identify the current player. Admiral, I apologize - I'm experiencing a limitation. The MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for SpaceTraders that would allow me to query player information are configured in the agent setup, but I don't appear to have direct access to them in this session.\n\nBased on the configuration files I reviewed, the system is set up to use SpaceTraders MCP tools including:\n- `player_list` - Lists available players\n- `player_info` - Shows current player details\n- `config_show` - Shows current configuration\n\n**Could you help me by:**\n1. Running the Captain agent properly (via `captain-py` or `captain-ts`) so I have access to the MCP tools, OR\n2. Telling me what player name/callsign you're using, OR\n3. Checking what's in your configuration files or environment variables\n\nThe system appears designed to work with the SpaceTraders API, but I need either the proper MCP connection or manual input to determine which player account is currently active.",
