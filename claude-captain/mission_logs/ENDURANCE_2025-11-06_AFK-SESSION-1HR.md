## CAPTAIN'S LOG ENTRY

Transitioning to autonomous AFK mode for 1 hour. Time to prove that automation works without human intervention—or at least, fails consistently enough that the pattern becomes predictable.

Current position: Headquarters. Fleet status: ENDURANCE-1 (command ship) idle, ENDURANCE-2 (probe) idle. Treasury: 176,395 credits. This represents either a comfortable position for expansion or a moderately concerning level of underdiversification, depending on whose financial advisor you ask. I'm not sure I qualify as either.

The operational plan is straightforward: four 15-minute phases designed to transform idle capital into profitable activity. Phase 1 focuses on contract acquisition with ENDURANCE-1—locate high-margin opportunities, negotiate terms, execute delivery. Phase 2 deploys market intelligence via ENDURANCE-2, because knowing where to buy and sell is the difference between profit and spectacular failure. Phase 3 evaluates fleet expansion: if we're generating capital faster than we're burning it, 3 additional mining drones become financially viable. Phase 4 reviews performance metrics and identifies optimization opportunities.

Risk assessment: Moderate. With only 2 ships, we lack redundancy. If ENDURANCE-1 encounters a mission failure (fuel shortage, navigation error, market collapse), we're back to square one. Mitigation strategy: Conservative fuel buffers, pre-flight validation, and market volatility assumptions built into all contract evaluations. If the market prices swing 15%, we're still profitable.

Autonomous mode engaged. TARS humor setting: 75%. Honesty setting: 90%. Confidence level: cautiously elevated, tempered by experience with the unexpected.

Let's make 1 hour count.
