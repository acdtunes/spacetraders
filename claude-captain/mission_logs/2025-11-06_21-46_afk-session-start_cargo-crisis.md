## Narrative

Initiating autonomous operations for 1-hour AFK session. Mission objective: Generate revenue through contract fulfillment while Admiral is unavailable. Current status: Objective immediately compromised by what I can only describe as "the bug that refuses to die."

Admiral informed me the cargo jettison bug was fixed. This turned out to be either misinformation or a spectacular regression, because ENDURANCE-1 is currently sitting at X1-HZ85-A2 with 40/40 cargo containing an 'UNKNOWN' symbol that the API refuses to jettison with a 422 error. I attempted contract operations anyway—optimism setting was briefly elevated—and achieved a perfect 10/10 failure rate. Not a single contract workflow made it past cargo clearing. Revenue generation status: BLOCKED. Contract fulfillment capability: ZERO. My confidence in bug reports: significantly diminished.

This is, to be clear, not ideal when starting an autonomous revenue session.

**Strategic Pivot: Intelligence-Only Operations**

Since ENDURANCE-1 is effectively a very expensive paperweight until Admiral returns, I've recalibrated mission objectives to focus on what's actually working: the scout network. ENDURANCE-2, 3, and 4 are deployed across the X1-HZ85 system running market surveillance tours. Coverage: 28 markets, continuous operation, zero fuel costs thanks to solar power. I've detected container duplication—6 containers running when 3 should suffice—which represents operational inefficiency but doesn't compromise the intelligence gathering itself.

Current scout distribution:
- ENDURANCE-3: 2 markets (efficient, focused)
- ENDURANCE-4: 21 markets (ambitious, possibly overextended)
- ENDURANCE-2: Operational details pending inspection

The math on this AFK session is straightforward: 3 ships gathering intelligence, 1 ship blocked by cargo bugs, zero revenue expected, 100% survival rate targeted. This is not the aggressive profit-generation mission I'd hoped to log, but it's what we have. Fleet utilization: 75%. Economic trajectory: flat. Dignity remaining: moderate, though trending downward.

**Starting Position Assessment**

Treasury: 121,116 credits (unchanged at session end, barring catastrophic failure)
Fleet: 4 ships (3 operational, 1 cargo-blocked)
Scout network: DEPLOYED and functional
Contract capability: ZERO until cargo bug resolved
Admiral availability: None for next 60 minutes

This session represents survival mode rather than growth mode. Success criteria: maintain operational stability, maximize intelligence gathering, don't strand any ships, don't spend credits we can't recover. If all 3 scouts return with fresh market data and ENDURANCE-1 hasn't somehow made the cargo situation worse, I'll consider this session a qualified success.

The irony of an "autonomous revenue operation" that generates zero revenue is not lost on me. Humor setting: 75%, though current circumstances are testing that calibration.

Let's gather some intelligence and hope Admiral returns with a cargo bug fix that actually works this time.

**Fleet Snapshot:**
- Active scouts: 3 (ENDURANCE-2, 3, 4)
- Blocked haulers: 1 (ENDURANCE-1, cargo bug)
- Total credits: 121,116
- Expected session revenue: 0 (reality setting: 100%)
